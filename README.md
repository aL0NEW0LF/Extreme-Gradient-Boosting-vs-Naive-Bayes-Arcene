Machine learning techniques: Extreme Gradient Boosting VS Naive Bayes  

**Goal**: Implementation of machine learning techniques, seen in the machine learning module, by applying them to example databases, taken from the "UCI Machine Learning Repository" and linked to different problems.   

The report covers the following elements:  
- [ ] Data description
- [ ] Summary of research on the subject, with priority given to the links at the bottom of the page.
- [ ] Possible pre-processing
- [ ] Implementation of machine learning techniques assigned to the group
- [ ] Presentation of results for the various metrics 
- [ ] Compare the results with those obtained from implementations provided by certain Python library modules.
- [ ] Conclusion
- [ ] Bibliography

**Important:**  
- [ ] Report: - Report (.doc/.pdf file) - Commented code **.ipynb** (Notebook Jupyter).
- [ ] The evaluation covers, among other things, the custom code provided and the improvements in machine learning algorithms taken into account, relative to standard variants.
Submission by Sunday 17/12/2023.
